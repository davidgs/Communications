### Non-work
Work accounts for a good portion of my time, of course, but it's not all of who I am.

In the Before Timesâ„¢ I was a complete nut about going to the gym. I went 5 days a week and was in pretty good shape (I could do 1,000 situps!). I'm back at the gym, but my age being what it is, I'm not back in the shape I was.

### Work
I'm a Principal Developer Advocate (DR4) at [Camunda](https://camunda.com?ref=davidgsiot) which is a Business Process Automation company based in Berlin, Germany. I work remotely from my home on North Carolina USA.

I've been working remotely for 15+ years now so if you're looking for tips on how to be effective as a remote worker, I'm happy to talk to you about it!

I'm currently doing a lot of work on tooling. I'm developing some tools to be used internally at Camunda, and in the wider DevRel Community, to automate some of the common DevRel tasks, and to better gather data about our communities and their health. This is an ongoing effort.

Speaking of the "wider DevRel Community," I am also one of the moderators (AKA `Benevolent Dictators`) for the [DevRel Collective](https://devrelcollective.fun). The Devrel Collective is a group of over 2,000 DevRel professionals on Slack where we talk about ... well, just about everything! I also just completely rebuilt their website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)

## My career

I did not take a 'traditional' path into tech. I even wrote a [whole thing](https://davidgs.com/posts/category/devrel/my-journey-into-tech-and-devrel/) on it a while back! But I've been in tech now longer than I was ever in anything else, so I guess I'm here to stay at this point.

One of the things about a bunch of my career is that I just *happened* to be in on some things at the start. Thin Client computing and IoT for example. I've been doing IoT now for more than 15 years (getting closer to 20, actually) and that's something not many people can say.

I'm hoping to somehow bring IoT and Camunda together in some way.

## What Does Success Mean to Me?

My Primary goal here is to help people. I call it Being of Service. It's sort of what my entire life is based on: being of maximum service to others. So being successful means I've helped someone. Or I've helped lots of people. I've made a positive impact on someone's life.

## Contacting me:

- **Issues:** Feel free to file issues here about any project I'm working on, etc.
- **Twitter:** Reach out any time on [twitter](https://twitter.com/davidgsIoT) about just about anything. DMs are always open too.
- **Slack:** If you're in one of the many Slack communities I'm in, feel free to reach out there.
- **Email:** Probably the least-reliable way to get me to respond. :-) But sure, [email me](mailto:davidgs@davidgs.com) if you feel absolutely compelled to.

**Personal Notes**: I deal with a couple of issues on an on-going basis which may (or may not) be impacting me at any given time:
- I suffer from chronic pain. Most days this isn't an issue for me as I've been dealing with it for so long but there are some days when it overwhelms me. I can get grumpy, short-tempered, etc. on those days. On a very few days I am completely debilitated by it and will be out.
- I deal with tinnitus all the time. During zoom meetings, etc. this is generally not an issue. But if we ever go back to in-person events please understand that in group situations, especially those that have a high level of background noise -- I likely have great difficulty hearing and understanding what is being said. If ears were treated like any other medical condition I'd ideallly have hearing aids to help me deal with it but they aren't, so I don't.
