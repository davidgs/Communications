### Non-work
Work accounts for a good portion of my time, of course, but it's not all of who I am.

I lift weights, I hang with my dogs, etc. I love woodworking, but I don't have a shop right now.

### Work
I'm a Principal Developer Advocate (DR4) at [Camunda](https://camunda.com?ref=davidgsiot) which is a Business Process Automation company based in Berlin, Germany. I work remotely from my home on North Carolina USA.

I've been working remotely for 15+ years now so if you're looking for tips on how to be effective as a remote worker, I'm happy to talk to you about it!

I am one of the moderators (AKA `Benevolent Dictators`) for the [DevRel Collective](https://devrelcollective.fun). The DevRel Collective is a group of over 2,500 DevRel professionals on Slack where we talk about ... well, just about everything! I also completely rebuilt their website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)

## My career

I did not take a 'traditional' path into tech. I even wrote a [whole thing](https://davidgs.com/posts/category/devrel/my-journey-into-tech-and-devrel/) on it a while back! But I've been in tech now longer than I was ever in anything else.

## What Does Success Mean to Me?

My Primary goal is to help people. I call it Being of Serviceâ„¢. It's sort of what my entire life is based on: being of maximum service to others. So being successful means I've helped someone. Or I've helped lots of people. I've made a positive impact on someone's life. It's why I mentor people in the industry. If you're looking for a mentor, let's talk.
